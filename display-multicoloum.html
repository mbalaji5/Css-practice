        <h1>Sample for multicolumn display

        <div class="column-width">
        <strong>column-width:200px</strong> or <strong>column-count</strong>
        <p>The multi-column layout module gives us a way to lay out content in columns, similar to how text flows in a newspaper. While reading up and down columns is less useful in a web context as you donâ€™t want to force users to scroll up and down, arranging content into columns can be a useful technique.

                To turn a block into a multicol container we use either the column-count property, which tells the browser how many columns we would like to have, or the column-width property, which tells the browser to fill the container with as many columns of at least that width.
                
                In the below example we start with a block of HTML inside a containing <div> element with a class of container.</p>

                    <p>We are using a column-width of 200 pixels on that container, causing the browser to create as many 200-pixel columns as will fit in the container and then share the remaining space between the created columns.

                            </p>
        </div>
